# 🤖 Automation 🤖

The files contained in the `app_configs` and `assay_configs` folders are essential for the automation process.

## 🔧 App configs 🔧

The files in the 001_Reference are placeholders for the actual app config files stored in DNAnexus as those contain tokens.

Other than that, those files contain:

- DEMULTIPLEX_APP_ID
- AUTH_TOKEN
- ASSAY_CONFIG_PATH
- SLACK_TOKEN
- SLACK_LOG_CHANNEL
- SLACK_ALERT_CHANNEL
- JIRA_EMAIL
- JIRA_TOKEN
- JIRA_QUEUE_URL
- JIRA_ISSUE_URL

## 🔧 Assay configs 🔧

Each assay require a config file to work in tandem with eggd_conductor. They are stored in folders named after the assay that they work with. Those will mainly specify:

- workflows/apps
  - name
  - version
  - repo url
  - arguments for use in eggd_conductor
- inputs of said workflows/apps
- links between outputs of the stages and inputs of subsequent stages

Additionally, details about the config file itself are stored such as version, assay or allowed users.
